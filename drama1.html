<h2>My Dangerous Wife</h2>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Based on the Japanese TV series of the same title, the series focuses on a married couple who once were madly in love <br>but ended up hating each other.
    Jae-kyung and Yoon-chul look like a perfect couple: a rich heiress with a kind heart and a handsome celebrity chef <br>got married after falling in love. After 6 years, however, they loathe the spouse. <br>Since Yoon-chul's restaurant business dwindles, the couple has friction for a while. While Jae-kyung worries that her husband <br>may have crossed the line with another woman, Yoon-chul tries to figure out how to get away from his wife's grip and make his business prosper. <br>That's when Jae-kyung gets kidnapped, and the suspect demands a massive ransom.
